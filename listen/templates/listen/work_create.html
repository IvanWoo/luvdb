                        On LʌvDB, we use a 3-level model to represent a musical work</a>: <strong>Work</strong> > <strong>Track</strong> > <strong>Release</strong>. This model enable us to create better linkage between different releases and recordings of a musical work, and build comprehensive discography for the creators. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A <strong>Work</strong> is an abstraction that encapsulates the core concept of a music work, it contains only the meta data that is common to different recordings of the work, such as the composers, lyricist, the original performers, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        A <strong>Work</strong> entry is not check-in-able. If you want to check in to a book, you need to create a <a href="{% url "listen:release_create" %}"><strong>Release</strong></a> entry.
                    </p>

                        The <a href="https://luvdb.com/listen/work/47/">Serenade for Strings, Op. 22</a> is a Work by <a href="https://luvdb.com/entity/creator/282/">Antonín Dvořák</a>. A Work can have multiple tracks, performed by various performers from different time. A track can be the performance of the work in its entirety or just <a href="https://luvdb.com/listen/track/62/">part of it</a>.
